# 04-react-query (rewritten)

This is a rewritten version of the Vite + React + TypeScript project that demonstrates:
- Searching movies via TMDB
- Pagination with react-paginate
- Data fetching and caching with @tanstack/react-query
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Components split into folders with CSS modules

To run:
1. Add your TMDB Bearer token to `.env` as `VITE_TMDB_TOKEN`.
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

This project was programmatically generated for the user during a code-refactor request.
